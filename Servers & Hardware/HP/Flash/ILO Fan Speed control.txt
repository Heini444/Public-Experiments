./build.sh 277  # generate iLO v2.77 patched firmware

#The build setup creates a build/ folder where all the artifacts are stored. The final firmware location will be printed at the end of the script, if no errors are produced.

#The resulting firmware is located in the build directory, under the firmware's name (e.g. build/ilo4_277.bin.patched for v2.77 builds). 
#Use following steps to flash the firmware, as you cannot do it from the web interface:

Remove power from your server, and enable iLO4 Security Override (for me, this was flipping the first DIP switch on the board).
Boot your server from a baremetal Linux install -- a Ubuntu LiveCD works well.

#Ensure any HP modules are unloaded (sudo modprobe -r hpilo)
sudo modprobe -r hpilo

#Copy the resulting firmware to a USB key, along with the flasher files (binaries/flash_ilo4 & binaries/CP027911.xml)
mkdir -p flash
cp binaries/flash_ilo4 binaries/CP027911.xml flash/

#Plug in the USB key, rename the firmware to ilo4_250.bin
cp build/ilo4_277.bin.patched flash/ilo4_250.bin

#change to flash dir
cd flash

#then run sudo ./flash_ilo4 --direct to patch your server.
sudo ./flash_ilo4 --direct

# wait until the fans spin down ...
sudo shutdown now 
#Remove power and disable the security override after shutting down!

Resist the urge to unplug the system and break everything while flashing. It will be loud. It took 2 minutes to erase, and 1 minute to flash.
After patching, shut down and remove power from the server to disable the iLO4 security override.
